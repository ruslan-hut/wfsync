## API Endpoints

### Authentication Required Endpoints

All endpoints under `/v1` require authentication. To authenticate, send a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

Example of an authenticated request:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/v1/wf/invoice/123' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer your-token-here'
```
### Response structure

API response always has the following structure

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {"response":  "payload"},
    "status_message": "Success",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-01T09:27:19Z"
}
```
`data` section may differ depending on endpoint purpose or may be null
